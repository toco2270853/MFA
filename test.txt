if you turn inward
there is a place within you
where you shall find 
solutions for everything
well, what is this place?
what is turning inward
first of all?
turning inward is not dissection.
travelling
to your liver, kidney, spleen
or something like that.
turning inward is not contemplation.
turning inward is not
psychiatric analysis.
what you call as my body and my mind
are two accumulations
of food and impressions.
so body and mind are external to you.
turning inward means
going beyond these two accumulations.
well, if we have to give it a name
let's call it chitta, or in english,
very misunderstood, misused word,
consciousness.
